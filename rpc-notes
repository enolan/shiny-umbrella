So, how do we want our RPC to work?
The client needs to send the following messages:
- recognized utterances
- hypotheses
- recognition start events
The server needs to receive those and send these:
- corrections
- context information, if possible
- enable/disable recognition forwarding
- trigger fake recognitions for testing

So my original thought was to use two-way JSON-RPC but that doesn't seem to be
supported at all in Python, and the Haskell library I found doesn't compile
anymore. I could write some Python code to do JSON-RPC and fix up the Haskell
library, or I could write a custom thing myself. I think it's probably simplest
to write a custom thing myself. Will use a very simple JSON thing.
